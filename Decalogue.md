## Data layer decalogue

1. All data must have metadata to be used in the project.

2. Teammates will have access to two Dropbox folders: (1) to upload new data **/Dropbox/Megadapt_integracion/CarpetasTrabajo** & (2) to access all data layers available  **/Dropbox/Megadapt_integracion/layers**

3. Teammates can deliver new data sets by uploading them to their personal folder under **/Dropbox/Megadapt_integracion/CarpetasTrabajo **
4. Teammates responsible for generating new data must ensure the data manager is aware of its existence (Github or edith@multicriteria.org). The data manager will review the data uploaded and store the data in the final repository to make it available to the team.

5. Github is the tool to discuss and communicate modifications, updates and processing data layers.

6. Any modification of a data layer requires creating a new version that ends with a “V” and the number of the version.

7. The lineage of a data layer must be recorded either in the metadata upon delivery, or posted in Github. The information required include: sources, assumptions, transformations, etc.

8. Data layers available for analysis will be stored in the following folders:

Final versions of inputs/outputs of models:  **/Dropbox/Megadapt_integracion/layers/final **

Older versions of inputs/outputs of models: **/Dropbox/Megadapt_integracion/layers/old **

Any other data layer available: **/Dropbox/Megadapt_integracion/layers/miscellaneous**

  A description of the most important features of all the data layers available are continually updated in the following catalog: **/Dropbox/Megadapt_integracion/layers/GIS_catalog.xlsx** (if an item needs to be translated from the catalog to ensure a correct interpretation of the data, please create an issue)

  To ensure the protection of data, Github will not be used as a repository. Therefore,  Dropbox links must not be posted, only paths with the location of the file(s).
